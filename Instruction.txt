In my project charter or my program "Student Information System," this is the way to use my program. First, you can see "Welcome" and "Please select an option." If you can choose between 1 and 2, number 1 for the student, the content of this student information, student grades, and student achievements. You can fill up first the student ID, student name, course, year level, and lastly the password. If you enter the wrong password, the program can't proceed to another information. If the password is correct, the program will continue to work. You can see in the above that if you select an option that you want to see, the choices will appear: option 1 for my grades, option 2 for my personal information, option 3 for my achievements, and if you don't have any transactions, please select option 4 to exit.
